## What We're Looking For

<!-- Reviewer Instructions:  Note that canned positive feedback is included at the bottom - adjust this as appropriate to the submission. -->

### Test Inspection 

<!-- Reviewer Instructions: You should look through their tests to see if they are covering each of these cases. If they are not, check the functionality in pry or irb. If they have a good test: yes. If there is no test but it works in irb: yes but no test. If the test is failing, or the functionality doesn't work: no -->

Workflow | yes / yes but no test / no
